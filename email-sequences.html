Here is a number that surprises most families: the average high-net-worth household works with 4-7 financial professionals who never coordinate with each other.

Accountant. Attorney. Broker. Insurance agent. Bank. Each one sees a single piece of your financial life. Nobody is looking at the complete picture.

This is what we call the Coordination Gap. It is the space between having good individual professionals and having them work as a system.

<strong>What the Coordination Gap actually costs:</strong>
- Tax strategies that conflict with investment decisions
- Estate plans that have not been updated since your last major life change
- Insurance coverage that overlaps in some areas and leaves blind spots in others
- Cash flow projections that do not account for the full picture

At Lansing Street Advisors, we built our entire practice around closing this gap.

That statistic is from a 20-year study by the Williams Group. 70% of family wealth disappears by the second generation. 90% by the third.

The families who beat those odds share three things in common:

<strong>1. They coordinate, not just accumulate.</strong>
<strong>2. They talk about money as a family.</strong>
<strong>3. They work with a fiduciary.</strong>

My family's own story starts in Kilkenny, Ireland. My ancestors came to the United States for a better future for their children and grandchildren. That same spirit is what drives our work at Lansing Street Advisors today.

Your Wealth Strategy Score of {{score}} is the starting point. What you do with it determines the trajectory.

Every family moves through three financial phases. Understanding which one you are in changes how you think about everything.

<strong>Phase 1: Accumulation</strong>
This is the building phase. Career growth, saving, investing, increasing income.

<strong>Phase 2: Preservation</strong>
You have built something meaningful. Now the priority shifts to protecting it.

<strong>Phase 3: Distribution</strong>
This is where wealth either transfers successfully to the next generation or erodes.

Most families do not realize they have moved from one phase to the next until they face a decision that demands the new mindset.

Your Wealth Strategy Score suggests you are building a strong foundation. The most powerful thing you can do right now is understand which phase you are in.

There is one question that separates advisors who work for you from those who work for themselves:

<strong>"Are you a legal fiduciary?"</strong>

A fiduciary is legally required to put your interests ahead of their own. Every recommendation. Every decision. No exceptions.

A broker operates under a "suitability" standard. They only need to recommend products that are "suitable" for you. Not necessarily the best option.

83% of Americans believe their financial advisor is a fiduciary. Only about 15% actually are.

Lansing Street Advisors is a SEC-registered fiduciary. We do not sell products. We do not earn commissions. We work for your family.

The average high-net-worth family overpays $30,000 to $80,000 in taxes annually.

Not because they have a bad accountant. Because their accountant, investment advisor, estate attorney, and insurance agent are not talking to each other.

<strong>How it plays out:</strong>
- Your investment advisor makes trades without considering the tax implications
- Your estate plan was written five years ago and does not reflect current assets
- Your insurance coverage was designed for a different phase of your financial life
- Your retirement accounts are structured for accumulation when you should be thinking about distribution

Nobody is doing anything wrong individually. The problem is that nobody is coordinating the whole picture.

This is what a family office approach solves. One team. One strategy. Every piece of your financial life working together.

Managing your own investments is smart early on. But there is a point where complexity outgrows what any single person can track.

<strong>Five signs you may have reached that point:</strong>

1. Your tax return is more than 15 pages
2. You own assets across more than three account types
3. You have experienced or are approaching a major life event
4. You are not sure how your investments connect to your tax strategy
5. You worry about whether your family would know what to do if something happened to you

If three or more apply, a conversation with a fiduciary advisor could save you time, money, and worry.

Your Wealth Strategy Score of {{score}} tells a clear story: you have a solid financial foundation with specific areas where better coordination could make a meaningful difference.

<strong>Gap 1: {{top_dimension_1}}</strong>
<strong>Gap 2: {{top_dimension_2}}</strong>

These gaps are not about having bad professionals. They are about decisions happening in silos.

When your tax strategy, investment approach, estate plan, and risk management are coordinated as one system, everything works harder. Less goes to taxes. More goes to your family.

I have spent 25 years watching what happens when families close these gaps. The difference is not subtle.

A family comes to us with $2-5 million in assets. They have a CPA, estate attorney, broker, separate insurance agent, and a bank. None of them are talking to each other.

When we bring everything under one roof, here is what typically changes:

<strong>Tax efficiency improves by 15-30%.</strong>
<strong>Estate plans get updated and stress-tested.</strong>
<strong>Insurance is right-sized.</strong>
<strong>The family gets one number to call.</strong>

This is what we mean by "Your Family's Personal Chief Financial Officer."

Your Wealth Strategy Score of {{score}} suggests your family is in a strong position to benefit from this kind of coordination.

I have been doing this for 25 years. I ran trading for a $1.5 billion hedge fund. I helped grow a mutual fund desk from $1.5 billion to $30 billion. I built a real estate fund with $50 million in assets.

But the work I am most proud of happens in our discovery meetings.

That is where a family sits down and, for the first time, sees their complete financial picture laid out in one place.

I am not going to pretend we are the right fit for every family. We are independent, fiduciary, and focused on families who want real coordination across their financial lives.

But if your Wealth Strategy Score resonated with you, I would like to have a conversation.

No pitch. No obligation. Just 30 minutes.

I want to be direct with you.

Your Wealth Strategy Score of {{score}} out of 100 indicates significant coordination gaps across your financial life.

Based on your answers, you are likely dealing with at least two of these situations:
- Financial professionals who are not coordinating with each other
- An estate plan that may not reflect your current wishes
- A portfolio that is not positioned for what comes next
- Cash flow planning that has not been stress-tested

We offer a complimentary discovery meeting. No sales pitch. No obligation. Just a clear-eyed look at your financial coordination.

<strong>Schedule your meeting:</strong> lansingadv.com/consultation
<strong>Or call directly:</strong> (215) 718-2063

The longer coordination gaps persist, the more they cost. In taxes. In missed opportunities. In peace of mind.

I know "schedule a meeting" sounds like the start of a sales process. Here is exactly what a discovery meeting looks like:

<strong>1. We listen.</strong> You tell us about your family and your financial situation.
<strong>2. We map your financial life.</strong> Most families have never seen the full picture in one place.
<strong>3. We identify the biggest coordination gaps.</strong>
<strong>4. We tell you what we would do.</strong> A clear, honest assessment.
<strong>5. You decide.</strong> No pressure. No follow-up calls unless you ask.

Whether you close those gaps with us or someone else, the important thing is that you close them.

A few days ago you took the Wealth Strategy Score assessment and scored {{score}} out of 100.

We shared your results, your radar chart, and three specific recommendations. But we have not heard from you since.

That is completely fine. Financial decisions deserve careful thought.

One thing worth considering: the coordination gaps your quiz revealed do not improve on their own. They tend to widen over time as life gets more complex.

The simplest next step is our complimentary discovery meeting. Thirty minutes. No obligation.

This is the last email in this series. I want to leave you with something genuinely useful.

<strong>The Four Pillars of Financial Success:</strong>

1. <strong>Wealth Enhancement</strong> -- Cash flow planning, tax mitigation, lifestyle maintenance.
2. <strong>Wealth Transfer</strong> -- Estate planning, trusts, wills, life insurance.
3. <strong>Wealth Protection</strong> -- Safeguarding against market volatility and the unexpected.
4. <strong>Investment Consulting</strong> -- Comprehensive portfolio strategy designed for your goals.

When these four pillars work together as a system, families preserve and grow wealth across generations. When they operate in silos, wealth erodes.
